# MuseCursor

# About
The MuseCursor is a desktop application that enables the user to control the computer's mouse cursor without having to use a mouse. It achieves this through the use of the Muse Headband, a new piece of wearable technology. Through the use of the Muse's accelerometers and a finite state machine we implemented ourselves, we are able to allow the user to control the mouse cursor using his head.

# Target Audience
The MuseCursor is a proof-of-concept project created during Hack the Planet, and is therefore not meant for production. However, we had a goal and a target audience in mind when we undertook this development. The goal is simply to allow the handicapped to be able to user computers effectively. Having no arms, for example, is a huge handicap when using a computer, since this means not being able to use a keyboard or a mouse. The MuseCursor is meant to address this problem by enabling users to control the mouse cursor with their heads instead.  

# Tools
The following are the tools we used to develop this project:
- Muse Headband and Muse SDK
- Python
- PyGame
- Qt Framework

# Note to Developers
Currently, developing for the Muse is a difficult task due to the lack of development going on, which translates to a lack of documentation and a general lack of learning resources. Furthermore, setting up a developer workstation for the Muse can be a long and painful experience. The following is a list of resources that we found are useful for Muse development. We hope they will help you as they have helped us.
